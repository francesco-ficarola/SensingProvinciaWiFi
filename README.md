SensingProvinciaWiFi
====================

This software allows to collect data from Wireless Sensors Networks and People-Centric Sensing systems and, then, it forwards all messages to a dedicated server on the Internet passing through a Provinciawifi Access Point. It implements an authentication mechanism using Captive Portal so as to achieve Internet connections and retrieve data from gateway devices plugged on PC's USB/Ethernet ports.
